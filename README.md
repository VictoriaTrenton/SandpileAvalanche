# SandpileAvalanche

## Description

Self-directed final project for third-year Computational Physics course

Author: Victoria Trenton


## Setup

Start with **Sandpile.cpp**.

Sample avalanches visualized in MATLAB are shown in **4 Avalanche Examples.PNG**.

"Avalanche outcomes from four simulations after about 9000 grains of sand 
were added to a 100x100 sandpile with 0, 100, 200, and 500 holes. The cells
have slopes ranging from 0 (dark blue) to 3 (light blue). Holes are represented
by bright red cells, and all cells where slopes changed during the last
avalanche are shown in dark red."
