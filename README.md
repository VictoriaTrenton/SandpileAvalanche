# SandpileAvalanche

## Description

Self-directed final project for third-year Computational Physics course

Author: Victoria Trenton

"The purpose of this sandpile study was to investigate the relationship of the distribution of avalanche sizes and the change in distribution after holes were added to the pile."


## Setup

Start with **Sandpile.cpp**.

## Preview

Sample avalanches visualized in MATLAB are shown in **4 Avalanche Examples.PNG**.

"Avalanche outcomes from four simulations after about 9000 grains of sand were added to a 100x100 sandpile with 0, 100, 200, and 500 holes. The cells have slopes ranging from 0 (dark blue) to 3 (light blue). Holes are represented by bright red cells, and all cells where slopes changed during the last avalanche are shown in dark red."
